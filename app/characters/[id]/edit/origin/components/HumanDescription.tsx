        Many ethnic groups are represented within the human species, some of which include distant singer ancestry.
        Although each ethnic group shares common physical characteristics among many of its people, these
        characteristics can express themselves very differently across individuals. Due to the Vorin "right of travel,"
        international relations, and diasporas born of conflict, most nations have some degree of ethnic diversity among
        citizens.

        The "Culture" section of this chapter discusses the nations of Roshar and the most common ethnicities of the
        people who live there.

      <p>
        If you choose the human ancestry, your size is Medium, and you gain the following benefits at the specified
        levels:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ancestry Bonus Talents (Level 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21).</strong> During step 5 of character creation, you
        gain one bonus talent. As a human, you must choose this talent from a heroic path (such as those in chapter 4).
        Whenever you reach a new tier (as indicated on the Character Advancement table in chapter 1), you again gain a
        bonus talent from a heroic path.
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, you must meet the prerequisites for these talents (see the "Advancing Through a Path" section of
        chapter 4).
