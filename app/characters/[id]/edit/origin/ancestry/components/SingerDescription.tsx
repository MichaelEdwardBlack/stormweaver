      <p>Singers are a humanoid species native to Roshar.</p>
      <p>
        They have a wide variety of forms, but most share some common traits, such as blue skin, red eyes, and a
        connection to the natural world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singers are often classified by their physical characteristics, which can include features such as additional
        limbs, unique skin patterns, or other non-human traits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singers have a deep connection to the natural world and the spiritual forces of Roshar, particularly through
        their relationship with spren. This connection often grants them unique abilities, such as enhanced senses or
        elemental powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Singers can change forms by bonding spren during highstorms, altering the singer's appearance and abilities.
